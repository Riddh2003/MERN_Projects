communication between parent to child component:
there are 3 ways to pass data...
1 -> props : property
            : props is an immutable object

    props destructuring: do not write props/object in child component and we write direct object value/keys.
    Disadvantage : props drilling : parent -> child -> most child

2 -> context
3 -> redux

DOM : document object model.

h.w -> Read about VDOM
virtual DOM : Light weighted copy of original project
VDOM = DOM -> then changes happend


Hooks : In Build Function | Lifecycle methods -> After (16.x)
